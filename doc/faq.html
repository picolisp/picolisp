<h3>Pico Lisp Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p align=right>(c) Software Lab. Alexander Burger

<dl>

<p><dt>Why did you write yet another Lisp?
<dd>Simply because other Lisps are not the way I want them to be. The history of
Pico goes back to 1988; at that time machine resources on PC's were limited and
existing Lisp systems not very usable. Today's Lisps concentrate on efficient
<u>compilation</u>, and lost the one-to-one relation of language and virtual
machine of an <u>interpreted</u> system.

<p><dt>Is there (or will be in the future) a compiler available?
<dd>No. That would contradict the idea of Pico's simple virtual machine
structure. A compiler transforms it to another (physical) machine, with the
result that many assumptions about the machine's behavior won't hold any more.
Besides that, Pico's primitive functions evaluate their arguments independently
and are not very much suited for being called from compiled code. Finally, the
gain in execution speed would probably not be worth the effort.

<p><dt>I cannot find the LAMBDA keyword in Pico.
<dd>Because it isn't there. The reason is that it is redundant; it is equivalent
to the <code>quote</code> function in all practical aspects. If you insist on
it, you can define your own <code>lambda</code>:

<p><pre><code>
: (setq lambda quote)
-> 67293272
: ((lambda (X Y) (+ X Y)) 3 4)
-> 7
: (mapcar (lambda (X) (+ 1 X)) '(1 2 3 4 5))
-> (2 3 4 5 6)
</code></pre>

<p><dt>Are there no problems caused by dynamic variable binding?
<dd>You mean the <i>funarg</i> problem, or problems that arise when a variable
might be bound to itself? For that reason it should be a convention to use only
transient symbols (and not internal symbols)

<ul>

<li>for all parameters and locals, when functional arguments or executable lists
are passed through the current dynamic scope.

<li>for a parameter or local, when that symbol might possibly be bound to itself

</ul>

<p><dt>What happens when I locally bind a symbol which has a function definition?
<dd>That's not a good idea. The next time that function gets executed within the
dynamic context the system may crash. Therefore we have the convention to use an
upper case first letter for variables, and otherwise for functions.
